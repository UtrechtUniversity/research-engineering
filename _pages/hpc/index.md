## High Performance and Cloud computing

Is your code running too slow on your laptop? Or are you unable to process large datasets? Do you need a professional sparring partner to discuss high-end computing solutions for your research project? Reach out to us for consultancy on High Performance Computing (HPC), cloud solutions and much more.

We have expertise in:
- High Performance Computing
- Virtual Research Environments
- Cloud Computing

In this [article](https://www.uu.nl/en/background/how-using-high-performance-computing-can-reduce-computation-time-from-three-months-to-one-day) you can read how High Performance Computing helped PhD Mariana Sim√µes during her research. Where HPC systems require some technical knowledge to operate, Virtual Research Environments allow the user to use the software they are used to interactively in a powerful virtual environment. Based on our user experience of the above platforms as engineers we can discuss your software in detail and help define requirements for the best compute solutions.

### What we can do for you

- Consultancy and support on choosing a suitable computing platform;
- Getting access to computing platforms;
- Consultancy and support when applying for funding;
- Giving support when getting started with computing platforms;
- Adapting your code and data for use on computing platforms.

### For whom?

All researchers and students at Utrecht University. From first-time users to experienced research groups.

### SURFsara credits

We provide a limited number of free credits (up to 10.000) for the national HPC and cloud systems at SURFsara (Snellius, Lisa, HPC Cloud and Research Cloud). These credits are meant for project start-ups, testing purposes and small research projects. To apply for credits, fill out the [application form available in Topdesk](https://uu.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=7f9fbf0c71f04be28de587258eae8490). For larger needs, check the [SURF website](https://www.surf.nl/en/apply-for-access-to-compute-services).

If you are not sure what to apply for, [contact us](../../index.md#contact) and we'll schedule an HPC consultancy meeting to get you started!
