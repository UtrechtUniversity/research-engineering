### Current projects

| Soothreat |
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 12/2022 - present |
| **Research domain**: Clinical Psychology |
| **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Topic Modeling, LDA | 
| **Research Engineers**: [Shiva Nadi](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/SNadiNajafabadi), [Raoul Schram](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RDSchram), Ken Krige | 
| In this project we are developing methods to help researchers to improve the understanding of threats and soothers for people with a central sensitivity syndrome (i.e., irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or chronic fatigue syndrome). Threats create experiences of danger, harm, damage, or unsafety and may worsen patients' physical symptoms. Soothers on the other hand create feelings of calmness, well-being, safety, or social connectedness and that may alleviate patients' physical symptoms. We are dealing with multiple topics and short texts in this project. |


| Better life index |
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 08/2022 - present |
| **Research domain**: Faculty of Humanities |
| **Technologies**: Python, Django, Flask | 
| **Research Engineers**:  [Roel Brouwer](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RJJBrouwer), [Jelle Treep](https://www.uu.nl/staff/HJTreep) |
| We create a backend for a web application for yearly publication of the Better life index ("Brede welvaart index") in the Netherlands. |

| Streetview - Water |
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 06/2022 - present |
| **Research domain**: Faculty of Veterinary Medicine |
| **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Visual Transformers, Docker | 
| **Research Engineers**:  [Raoul Schram](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RDSchram), [Maarten Schermer](https://github.com/maartenschermer) |
| We are using recent computer vision models based on Visual Transformers for semantic segmentation, assigning semantic classes such as "street", "vegetation" and "water" to the pixels of photos taken in the urban environment. This will be used for further research into the effect of the presence of water bodies and vegetation on human well-being. |

| Semantics of Sustainability |
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 07/2022 - present |
| **Research domain**: Faculty of Humanities, History and Art History |
| **Technologies**: Python, NLP, BERT, Deep learning, Huggingface Transformers | 
| **Research Engineers**: [Parisa Zahedi](https://www.uu.nl/staff/PZahedi)| 
| The aim of this project is to investigatate the conceptual history of a certain topic in a collection of texts. To this end we work on Dutch language models for historical research. The current available language models for Dutch (at time of writing) fall short for historical research, because they are trained only on recent data. The performance of models declines steadily when applied to data that lies outside of the distribution of the training on corpora.

| [MetaSynth](https://github.com/sodascience/meta-synth) | 
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 04/2022 - present |
| **Research domain**: Department of Methodology & Statistics |
| **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning, Synthetic data, Privacy | 
| **Research Engineers**:  [Raoul Schram](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RDSchram) |
| Privacy and proper disclosure control is a hot topic at the moment. This project aims to create a standard to share statistical information and generate synthetic data. MetaSynth fits a distribution to each of the variables, while it also generates a synthetic dataset from this information. In between, there is a generative metadata file that contains the condensed information as a human-readable JSON file. |

| [Patents](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/patent-breakthrough) | 
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 06/2022 - present |
| **Research domain**: Faculty of Law, Economics and Governance |

| We use multiple Natural Language Processing ML methods to predict whether a particular patent is a breakthrough innovation or not. This project includes work to simplify the whole pipeline from reading the patents, preprocessing, prediction and analysis. |

| [TORS](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/cTORS) | 
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 10/2021 - present |
| **Research domain**: Faculty of Science, Information and Computing Sciences |
| **Technologies**: Python, Django, Docker, C++ | 
| **Research Engineers**: [Roel Brouwer](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RJJBrouwer), [Haili Hu](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/HHu2) |
| In this project, we define the requirements to set up a scientific challenge in the domain of Train Unit Shunting and Servicing, using the TORS simulator developed by Utrecht University and TUDelft. In between transportation services, trains are parked and serviced at shunting yards. The objective of the challenge is to test the robustness and flexibility of scheduling algorithms, that position all the trains at the right position and get the maintenance tasks done in limited run time. |


| [Precision Nudging](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/nudging) | 
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 04/2021 - present |
| **Research domain**: Faculty of Law, Economics and Governance, Public Governance and Management |
| **Technologies**: Python, machine learning, regression analysis, synthetic data | 
| **Research Engineers**: [Haili Hu](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/HHu2), [Raoul Schram](https://www.uu.nl/staff/RDSchram)|
| Changing behavior is necessary to tackle societal problems, such as obesity and financial problems. One way to change behavior is by nudging people. A nudge is a way to change behavior without prohibiting options or changing its costs. However, nudges are often one-size-fits-all techniques: everyone is offered the same nudge. The scientific aim of this project is to use open data to develop predictive models with Machine Learning, in order to determine the most effective nudge for persons, given the nudging goal and the individual personal circumstances. To test our models, we created realistic synthetic data. |
