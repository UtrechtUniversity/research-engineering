### Current projects

| [Ocean Parcels Numba](https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels) | 
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 07/2021 - present |
| **Research domain**: Faculty of Science, Physical Oceanography |
| **Technologies**: Python, Numba | 
| **Research Engineers**: [Roel Brouwer](uu.nl/staff/RJJBrouwer) and Raoul Schram |
| Investigating the feasibility of speeding up existing Python code for [Parcels](https://oceanparcels.org) using Numba. The aim is to speed up the simulation enough to eliminate the need for a separate (partial) JIT/C path in the code. This should lead to a more flexible and maintainable code base. |

| [Dynamiek in beeld]| 
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 2021 - present |
| **Research domain**: ODISSEI Social Data Science Team (SoDa) |

| An application that can be used in a clinical setting to score dynamics in empathy. There are some questions to be asked whereafter the results are visualized. The visualization should help the clinician to ask the right questions immediately. |   

| [Precision Nudging](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/nudging) | 
| --- | 
| **Time frame**: 04/2021 - present |
| **Research domain**: Faculty of Law, Economics and Governance, Public Governance and Management |
| **Technologies**: Python, machine learning, regression analysis, synthetic data | 
| **Research Engineers**: [Haili Hu](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/HHu2), Raoul Schram|
| Changing behavior is necessary to tackle societal problems, such as obesity and financial problems. One way to change behavior is by nudging people. A nudge is a way to change behavior without prohibiting options or changing its costs. However, nudges are often one-size-fits-all techniques: everyone is offered the same nudge. The scientific aim of this project is to use open data to develop predictive models with Machine Learning, in order to determine the most effective nudge for persons, given the nudging goal and the individual personal circumstances. To test our models, we created realistic synthetic data. |
