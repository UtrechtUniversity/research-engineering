## Research and grant proposals

Do you have a brilliant idea for a research proposal? Do you lack the technical knowledge to turn it into a solid approach? We can help you during the exploration and writing phase.
[Reach out](#get-in-touch) to us for consultancy or a
short-term project 


### Long-term engineering support

In some research projects long-term engineering support may be required. When we are involved in the proposal stage, our support may be included in the budget. 
For this, we apply the following conditions:
* we follow the same selection procedure as for our shorter projects
* the researcher is willing to pay a minimum of 0.5 fte 
* the money is used to expand the research engineering team 
* the project will be part of the team portfolio, which means that, depending on the required expertise, different engineers can be assigned to the project


### Data support

Our [RDM](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management) colleagues from the University Library can contribute to 
research proposals by providing consultancy on topics like data management, data storage and handling personal data. 
As with research engineers, long-term support from [data managers](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/tools-services/experienced-data-managers) can be budgeted.


### Funding opportunities
