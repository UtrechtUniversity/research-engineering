# Manuals

## Aim
The manuals on this page are about installing software, transferring data or setting up computing environments. These are personal notes that we think are handy for reuse. They will not be actively maintained, so it could be that some of them are outdated. Feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/rse-team/issues) or pull request if something is not working, we will be happy to provide updates.
