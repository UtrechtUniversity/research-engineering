# Template Guide

## Step 1: Use \<Step X> to help readers move from one point to the next

* More steps are better than longer ones
* Steps are created as Heading 1 (`#`)

## Step 2: Prefer code examples to words

* Copying code is simpler than writing for users, try to always provide a snippet using the  \`\`\`  syntax

## Step 3: Make use of "hints" and alerts to draw attention to the most important sections

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an example of an hint
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you click on the "i" on the hint you can switch between alert (this one)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
And danger (this one)
{% endhint %}
