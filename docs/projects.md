# list of projects

| [Ocean Parcels Numba](https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels) | 
| --- | 
| 01/07/2021 - now |
| Faculty of Science |
| Technologies: Python, numba | 
| RSEs: [Roel Brouwer](uu.nl/staff/RJJBrouwer) and Raoul Schram |
| Investigating the feasibility of speeding up existing Python code for [Parcels](oceanparcels.org) using numba. The aim is to speed up the simulation enough to eliminate the need for a separate (partial) JIT/C path in the code. This should lead to a more flexible and maintainable code base. |

| [Ocean Parcels particle-particle interaction](https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels) | 
| --- | 
| 01/07/2020 - 30/06/2021 |
| Faculty of Science |
| Technologies: Python, datastructures, simulation | 
| RSEs: [Roel Brouwer](uu.nl/staff/RJJBrouwer) and Raoul Schram |
| Providing a working implementation of particle-particle interaction for [Parcels](oceanparcels.org). The aim was to allow simulated particles to interact and influence each others states. This project involved reviewing and partially restructuring the data structures that Parcels uses for storing particle data, and implementing particle-particle interaction under certain conditions. |

| [Network Entropy](https://github.com/qubixes/temporal-network-synthesis) |
| --- | 
| 2020-2021 |
| Department of Information and Computing Sciences |
| Temporal networks, Python, numba, simulation | 
| Raoul Schram |
| To improve the theoretical analysis and comparison of different temporal networks, we have invented a new metric to study them. The measure is called network entropy, and is applicable to any temporal network. We showed with simulations that processes on a network behave very differently, depending on the network entropy. |

| [Protosc](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/protosc) |
| --- | 
| 2020-2021 |
| Faculty of Social Sciences |
| Feature selection, Python, image classification, wrapper, filter, genetic algorithm | 
| Raoul Schram, Roos Voorvaart |
| Protosc is a Python library that aims to determine which features are relevant to a given classification problem. It does so by using wrapper/filter/genetic algorithms, after which automatic statistical analysis is used to determine which features are significant. The package also includes a few different options for an image classification pipeline. |

| [Porpoise Reproduction](https://github.com/lonnekeijsseldijk/porpoise-reproduction) | 
| --- | 
| 2020-2020 |
| Faculty of Veterinary Medicine |
| Technology and methods: R, sf, raster, rgdal | 
| RSEs involved: [Jelle Treep](https://www.uu.nl/staff/HJTreep), Roos Voorvaart |
| Porpoise Reproduction studies how reproduction rates of harbour porpoises are affected by various factors. In this RSE project [marine regions](marineregions.org) were enriched with [Cumulative Human Impact model data](knb.ecoinformatics.org) | 

| [Streetview 1](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/streetview-greenery) |
| --- | 
| 2019-2021 |
| Faculty of Geosciences |
| Machine learning, Python, image segmentation, deeplab, kriging, geolocation, CityScapes | 
| Raoul Schram |
| For the streetview project we have used the (formerly) open street view data from the municipality of Amsterdam to create a map of the greenness. This is done by taking the images and segmenting each image into different classes. The number of pixels in each image belonging to the "greenery" class is used to create the Amsterdam greenery map. |

| [ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) | 
| --- | 
| 2018-2021 |
| Faculty of Social Sciences |
| Machine learning, active learning, Python, flask, hyperparameter optimization, simulation | 
| Raoul Schram, Parisa Zahedi, Jonathan de Bruin |
| ASReview is a machine learning tool to aid researchers in performing systematic reviews. It uses active learning to present users with more likely relevant papers. It has been written in Python 3.7+, and hyper parameters have been optimized using the hyperopt package. We have also contributed to the initial back-end for the user interface using flask. |
