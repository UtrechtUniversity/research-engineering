### Current projects

|NTX - Data organisation and treansfer to new Yoda instance|
|---|
| **Time frame**: 09/2025 - present |
| **Research domain**:  DGK, Data management |
| **Technologies**: Python, iBridges, Yoda |
| **Research Engineers**: [Christine Staiger](https://www.uu.nl/staff/CStaiger)
| The project came in through Bertil in the course of reducing costs for Yoda users, finding duplicate data in Yoda instances and moving data to the new SURF instance. 
Next to that it is an educative project. The research group needs some more skills in the technical handling of their data between their local storage (NAS) and Yoda. |

| Noise exposure|
|---------------| 
| **Time frame**: 09/2025 - present |
| **Research domain**: Urban Geography / Environmental Geography |
| **Technologies**: R, geospatial data, PostgreSQL/PostGIS | 
| **Research Engineers**: [Maarten Schermer](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/MDSchermer) , [Parisa Zahedi](https://www.uu.nl/staff/PZahedi) |
| In the Noise exposure project, we aim to run a noise exposure model, developed by a PhD student, for all addresses in Europe. While the model has been applied before, the results contained substantial missing data, likely due to computational limitations. The current input data alone amounts to around 0.5 TB, making the task highly demanding in terms of computation and storage. This project seeks to process the data and execute the model at the European scale, ensuring complete and reliable results. |

|IMAU-FDM - Firn densification model |

| The Neurotoxicology Research Group at the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS) investigates the effects of environmental chemicals on brain function using microelectrode array (MEA) technology. This technique generates large-scale electrophysiological data (terabytes in size) by recording neuronal activity across multiple exposure scenarios, concentrations, and time points. Currently, data processing relies on inefficient MS Excel macros. The aim of this project is to develop an automated workflow for processing, analyzing, and visualizing these complex data. This will enhance efficiency, enable clear and effective visual representation for both scientific and general audiences, and facilitate pattern recognition for chemical effects. The processed data and visualizations will be integrated into a user-friendly database for better data tracking and accessibility. |

| Changing behavior is necessary to tackle societal problems, such as obesity and financial problems. One way to change behavior is by nudging people. A nudge is a way to change behavior without prohibiting options or changing its costs. However, nudges are often one-size-fits-all techniques: everyone is offered the same nudge. The scientific aim of this project is to use open data to develop predictive models with Machine Learning, in order to determine the most effective nudge for persons, given the nudging goal and the individual personal circumstances. To test our models, we created realistic synthetic data. |
