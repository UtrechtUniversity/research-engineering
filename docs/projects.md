# list of projects

| [Ocean Parcels Numba](https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels) | 
| --- | 
| 01/07/2021 - now |
| Faculty of Science |
| Technologies: Python, numba | 
| Research Engineers: [Roel Brouwer](uu.nl/staff/RJJBrouwer) and Raoul Schram |
| Investigating the feasibility of speeding up existing Python code for [Parcels](oceanparcels.org) using numba. The aim is to speed up the simulation enough to eliminate the need for a separate (partial) JIT/C path in the code. This should lead to a more flexible and maintainable code base. |

| [Precision Nudging](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/nudging) | 
| --- | 
| 04/2021 - now |
| Faculty of Law, Economics and Governance, Public Governance and Management |
| Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, data simulation | 
| Research Engineers: [Haili Hu](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/HHu2), Raoul Schram|
| Changing behavior is necessary to tackle societal problems, such as obesity and financial problems. One way to change behavior is by nudging people. A nudge is a way to change behavior without prohibiting options or changing its costs. However, nudges are often one-size-fits-all techniques: everyone is offered the same nudge. The scientific aim of this project is to use open data to develop predictive models with Machine Learning, in order to determine the most effective nudge for persons, given the nudging goal and the individual personal circumstances.|

| [Data Donation - proof of concept](https://github.com/eyra/port-poc) | 
| --- | 
| 04/2021-10/2021 |
| Faculty of Social Sciences, Human Data Science group |
| Technologies: Python, WebAssembly, Pyodide, Data Faker | 
| Research Engineers: [Haili Hu](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/HHu2), Roos Voorvaart |
| In this project, we collaborated with the [Human Data Science group](https://hds.sites.uu.nl/) and [Eyra](https://www.eyra.co/) to make data from social media platforms easily accessible to researchers, while preserving privacy. Respondents can voluntary donate their data download packages through an online platform (PORT), and researchers can provide custom data extraction scripts, which will be run locally on the respondentâ€™s devices. A proof-of-concept PORT has been developed by Eyra, while data extraction scripts and fake data packages were provided by the Research Engineering team.|


| [Ocean Parcels particle-particle interaction](https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels) | 
| --- | 
| 01/07/2020 - 30/06/2021 |
| Faculty of Science |
| Technologies: Python, datastructures, simulation | 
| Research Engineers: [Roel Brouwer](uu.nl/staff/RJJBrouwer) and Raoul Schram |
| Providing a working implementation of particle-particle interaction for [Parcels](oceanparcels.org). The aim was to allow simulated particles to interact and influence each others states. This project involved reviewing and partially restructuring the data structures that Parcels uses for storing particle data, and implementing particle-particle interaction under certain conditions. |

| [Network Entropy](https://github.com/qubixes/temporal-network-synthesis) |
| --- | 
| 2020-2021 |
| Department of Information and Computing Sciences |
| Technologies: Temporal networks, Python, numba, simulation | 
| Research Engineers: Raoul Schram |
| To improve the theoretical analysis and comparison of different temporal networks, we have invented a new metric to study them. The measure is called network entropy, and is applicable to any temporal network. We showed with simulations that processes on a network behave very differently, depending on the network entropy. |

| [Protosc](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/protosc) |
| --- | 
| 2020-2021 |
| Faculty of Social Sciences |
| Technologies: Feature selection, Python, image classification, wrapper, filter, genetic algorithm | 
| Research Engineers: Raoul Schram, Roos Voorvaart |
| Protosc is a Python library that aims to determine which features are relevant to a given classification problem. It does so by using wrapper/filter/genetic algorithms, after which automatic statistical analysis is used to determine which features are significant. The package also includes a few different options for an image classification pipeline. |

| [Animal Sounds](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/animal-sounds) | 
| --- | 
| 2019-2021 |
| Faculty of Science |
| Technologies: bioacoustics, audio, librosa, machine learning, deep learning, feature engineering | 
| Research Engineers: [Jelle Treep](https://www.uu.nl/staff/HJTreep), [Parisa Zahedi](https://www.uu.nl/staff/PZahedi), Casper Kaandorp |
| We developed algorithms and a data processing workflow to detect vocalizations of Chimpanzees in a large body of audio data from the African tropical rainforest. The workflow consists of: 1) a filtering step where irrelevant audio data is removed to speed up manual annotation, 2) a feature engineering and feature selection step, and 3) classification using support vector machines and convolutional neural networks |

| [Porpoise Reproduction](https://github.com/lonnekeijsseldijk/porpoise-reproduction) | 
| --- | 
| 2020-2020 |
| Faculty of Veterinary Medicine |
| Technologies: R, sf, raster, rgdal | 
| Research Engineers: [Jelle Treep](https://www.uu.nl/staff/HJTreep), Roos Voorvaart |
| Porpoise Reproduction studies how reproduction rates of harbour porpoises are affected by various factors. In this RSE project [marine regions](marineregions.org) were enriched with [Cumulative Human Impact model data](knb.ecoinformatics.org) |

| [Streetview 1](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/streetview-greenery) |
| --- | 
| 2019-2021 |
| Faculty of Geosciences |
| Technologies: Machine learning, Python, image segmentation, deeplab, kriging, geolocation, CityScapes | 
| Research Engineers: Raoul Schram |
| For the streetview project we have used the (formerly) open street view data from the municipality of Amsterdam to create a map of the greenness. This is done by taking the images and segmenting each image into different classes. The number of pixels in each image belonging to the "greenery" class is used to create the Amsterdam greenery map. |

| [ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) | 
| --- | 
| 2018-2021 |
| Faculty of Social Sciences |
| Technologies: Machine learning, active learning, Python, flask, hyperparameter optimization, simulation | 
| Research Engineers: Raoul Schram, [Parisa Zahedi](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/PZahedi), Jonathan de Bruin |
| ASReview is a machine learning tool to aid researchers in performing systematic reviews. It uses active learning to present users with more likely relevant papers. It has been written in Python 3.7+, and hyper parameters have been optimized using the hyperopt package. We have also contributed to the initial back-end for the user interface using flask. |
