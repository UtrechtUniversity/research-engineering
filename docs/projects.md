| Changing behavior is necessary to tackle societal problems, such as obesity and financial problems. One way to change behavior is by nudging people. A nudge is a way to change behavior without prohibiting options or changing its costs. However, nudges are often one-size-fits-all techniques: everyone is offered the same nudge. The scientific aim of this project is to use open data to develop predictive models with Machine Learning, in order to determine the most effective nudge for persons, given the nudging goal and the individual personal circumstances. To test our models, we created realistic synthetic data. |
