## Template Guide

#### Step 1: Use \<Step X> to help readers move from one point to the next

* More steps are better than longer ones
* Steps are created as Heading 1 (`#`)

#### Step 2: Prefer code examples to words

* Copying code is simpler than writing for users, try to always provide a snippet using the  \`\`\`  syntax
