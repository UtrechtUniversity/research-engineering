### Introduction

As a researcher you may want to know which technologies are available to answer your research question. Or you would like to use a specific technology or data source but need guidance or support to do so. The Research Engineering team can help you with these issues.

We support researchers at Utrecht University in applying digital technologies in various stages of their research. We can help you with technological challenges on, for example, data handling and computing, but we also consult on methodological issues, like the selection of the most suitable research approach or the validation of results.

We collaborate with researchers from a wide variety of domains and all faculties. In each project we gain new knowledge and expertise, which we can apply in our following projects, often in other domains. Our mission is to increase the impact of research by facilitating and inspiring research teams with distinctive knowledge and solutions.


### Our team

Our team of Research Engineers has extensive experience in both research and software development in multiple domains, ranging from social sciences to natural sciences.

- Software development:
  - python, R, matlab
  - git
  - unit testing
  - continuous integration

### How we work

In our engineering projects, we closely work together with researchers for a specific period. Our approach combines experience in both academic research and engineering. We have a diverse group of engineers with a variety of skills and expertise.

We provide consultancy and engineering in research projects in various formats:

- Consultancy in your project is always possible. Typically, consultancy consists of one or two meetings where we discuss your project and offer technical advice free of charge.
- We also offer short-term engineering support as a free service. During a period of a few months, you will have regular meetings with one or two Research Engineers, with the aim of developing a proof-of-concept or exploring a new method for your research.
- Long-term support is possible and can be tailored to your project, when we are included in the project budget. We can also help you write the techincal aspect of your research proposal, in which our support is included.

Due to our limited capacity, our engineering support in your project cannot be guaranteed. Our aim is to help researchers throughout Utrecht University and to keep innovating as a team, so we select our projects accordingly.
