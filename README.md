### Introduction

As a researcher you may want to know which technologies are available to answer your research question. Or you would like to use a specific technology or data source, but need guidance or support to do so. The research engineering team can help you with these issues.

We support researchers at Utrecht University in applying digital technologies in various stages of their research. We can help you with technological challenges on, for example, data handling and computing, but we also consult on methodological issues, like the selection of the most suitable research approach or the validation of results.

We collaborate with researchers from a wide variety of domains. In each project we gain new knowledge and expertise, which we can apply in our following projects, often in other domains. Our mission is to use digital technologies to boost research at Utrecht University.

- Data collection and analysis, e.g.,
  - web scraping
  - processing sensor data
  - neural networks
  - audio and video analysis
  - text mining
  - network analysis
  - geospatial analyses
- Computing, e.g.,
  - selection and use of High Performance and Cloud computing external link and facilities
  - parallelization and optimization
- Software development, e.g.,
  - python, R, matlab
  - shiny apps
  - git
  - unit testing
  - continuous integration

### How we work

In our engineering projects, we closely work together with researchersfor a specific period. Our approach combines experience in both academic research and engineering. We have a diverse group of engineers with a variety of skills and expertise.

We provide consultancy and engineering, both as free services. Consultancy in your project is always possible. Due to our limited capacity, our engineering support in your project cannot be guaranteed. Our aim is to help researchers throughout Utrecht University and to keep innovating as a team, so we select our projects accordingly.
