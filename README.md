### What we do
We support researchers at Utrecht University in applying digital technologies in various stages of their research. We can help you with technological challenges on, for example, data handling and computing, but we also consult on methodological issues, like the selection of the most suitable research approach or the validation of results.

We collaborate with researchers from a wide variety of domains and faculties. In our engineering projects, we closely work together with researchers for a specific period of time. Our unique approach combines experience in both academic research and engineering. In each project we gain new knowledge and expertise, which we can apply in our following projects, often in other domains. Our mission is to increase the impact of research by facilitating and inspiring research teams with distinctive knowledge and solutions.

We can help you with, for example:
- finding the appropiate digital technology for your research;
- developing [FAIR](https://fair-software.nl/) research software to answer your research question;
- selecting and using [High Performance and Cloud computing](docs/hpc.md) facilities;
- formulating the technical aspect of your research plan or grant proposal.

### How we do it
We provide consultancy and engineering in research projects in various formats:
- **Consultancy** in your project is always possible. Typically, consultancy consists of one or two meetings where we discuss your project and offer technical advice free of charge.
- We also offer **short-term engineering** support as a free service. During a period of a few months, you will have regular meetings with one or two Research Engineers, with the aim of developing a proof-of-concept or exploring a new method for your research.
- **Long-term support** is possible and can be tailored to your project, provided that funding is available for our services. We can also help you write the technical aspect of your grant proposal, in which our support is included.

Due to our limited capacity, our engineering support in your project cannot be guaranteed. Our aim is to help researchers throughout Utrecht University and to keep innovating as a team, so we select our projects accordingly. We give priority to projects that align with the Utrecht University [mission and vision](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/profile/mission-and-strategy) to work towards a better world.
