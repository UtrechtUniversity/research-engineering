### Introduction

As a researcher you may want to know which technologies are available to answer your research question. Or you would like to use a specific technology or data source but need guidance or support to do so. The Research Engineering team can help you with these issues.

We support researchers at Utrecht University in applying digital technologies in various stages of their research. We can help you with technological challenges on, for example, data handling and computing, but we also consult on methodological issues, like the selection of the most suitable research approach or the validation of results.

We collaborate with researchers from a wide variety of domains and faculties. In our engineering projects, we closely work together with researchers for a specific period of time. Our unique approach combines experience in both academic research and engineering. In each project we gain new knowledge and expertise, which we can apply in our following projects, often in other domains. Our mission is to increase the impact of research by facilitating and inspiring research teams with distinctive knowledge and solutions.

### How a research engineer can help you

We offer a broad range of skills and expertise including, but not limited to:
- Data collection and analysis:
  - processing sensor data
  - machine learning (e.g. neural networks)
  - audio and video analysis
  - text mining
  - network analysis
  - geospatial analyses
- Computing:
  - selection and use of [High Performance and Cloud computing](docs/hpc.md) and facilities
  - parallelization and optimization
- Software development:
  - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) software
  - python, R, matlab
  - version control (e.g. git)
  - unit testing
  - continuous integration

### How we work

We provide consultancy and engineering in research projects in various formats:
- **Consultancy** in your project is always possible. Typically, consultancy consists of one or two meetings where we discuss your project and offer technical advice free of charge.
- We also offer **short-term engineering** support as a free service. During a period of a few months, you will have regular meetings with one or two Research Engineers, with the aim of developing a proof-of-concept or exploring a new method for your research.
- **Long-term support** is possible and can be tailored to your project, when we are included in the project budget. We can also help you write the technical aspect of your research proposal, in which our support is included.

Due to our limited capacity, our engineering support in your project cannot be guaranteed. Our aim is to help researchers throughout Utrecht University and to keep innovating as a team, so we select our projects accordingly. We give priority to projects that align with the Utrecht University [mission and vision](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/profile/mission-and-strategy) to work towards a better world.
