#### Our mission
Researchers of all domains increasingly require the use of digital technologies in their work. Our team caters to this need by collaborating with researchers in projects and consulting them on research IT matters. By doing so, we act as a knowledge hub where expertise gained in temporary projects are safeguarded and used for cross-pollination across domains. At the same time, we provide a collaborative community for researchers and IT staff at Utrecht University. 

Our mission is to help researchers increase the impact of their work.


#### Who we are
We are a diverse team of Research Engineers with extensive experience in software development and academic research, with backgrounds in e.g. computer science, software engineering, data science, physics and geoscience. 

These Research Engineers offer you their expertise:
- [Roel Brouwer, MSc](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/RJJBrouwer)
- [Shiva Nadi Najafabadi, MSc](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/SNadiNajafabadi)
- [Dr. Haili Hu](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/HHu2)
- Casper Kaandorp, MSc
- Dr. Raoul Schram
- [Dr. Jelle Treep](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/HJTreep)
- [Dr. Martine de Vos](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/MGdeVos)
- [Parisa Zahedi, PDEng](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/PZahedi)

Our skills and expertise include:
  - machine learning;
  - text mining;
  - web scraping;
  - data analysis;
  - high performance computing;
  - computer modelling and simulations;
  - Python, R, MATLAB, FORTRAN, Docker, Shiny and much more.

#### What we do
We support UU researchers of all domains in various stages of their research; from social sciences to natural sciences, from students to professors, from planning to execution.

Our core activities are:
- developing sustainable and robust research software;
- training researchers in software best practices;
- building a research software community at Utrecht University.

We can help you with, for example:
- defining technical implementation of your research plan or grant proposal;
- assessing technical feasability of your research method;
- finding the appropiate digital technology for your research;
- developing [FAIR](https://fair-software.nl/) research software to anwer your research question;
- setting up a data processing pipeline;
- selecting and using [High Performance and Cloud computing](docs/hpc.md) facilities;
- connecting to potential knowledge partners.

#### How we work
We provide consultancy and engineering in research projects in various formats:
- **Consultancy** in your project is always possible. Typically, consultancy consists of one or two meetings where we discuss your project and offer technical advice free of charge.
- We also offer **short-term engineering** support as a free service. During a period of a few months, you will have regular meetings with one or two Research Engineers, with the aim of developing a proof-of-concept or exploring a new method for your research.
- **Long-term support** is possible and can be tailored to your project, provided that funding is available for our services. We can also help you write the technical aspect of your grant proposal, in which our support is included.

We do not merely produce software on behalf of researchers; we work collaboratively and iteratively, since we depend on the researcher's domain expertise to steer the project. Furthermore, a close collaboration enables researchers to build digital skills and thereby empowering them in their work. We therefore expect researchers to be committed to regular meetings for the duration of the project.

Due to our limited capacity, support in your project cannot be guaranteed. Our aim is to help researchers throughout Utrecht University and to keep innovating as a team, so we select our projects accordingly. We give priority to projects that align with the Utrecht University [mission and vision](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/profile/mission-and-strategy) to work towards a better world.
