### Introduction

As a researcher you may want to know which technologies are available to answer your research question. Or you would like to use a specific technology or data source, but need guidance or support to do so. The research engineering team can help you with these issues.

We support researchers at Utrecht University in applying digital technologies in various stages of their research. We can help you with technological challenges on, for example, data handling and computing, but we also consult on methodological issues, like the selection of the most suitable research approach or the validation of results.

We collaborate with researchers from a wide variety of domains. In each project we gain new knowledge and expertise, which we can apply in our following projects, often in other domains. Our mission is to  increase the impact of research by facilitating and inspiring research teams with distinctive knowledge and solutions.

### How we work

In our engineering projects, we closely work together with researchers for a specific period. Our approach combines experience in both academic research and engineering. We have a diverse group of engineers with a variety of skills and expertise.

We provide consultancy and engineering in research projects. Consultancy in your project is always possible and free of charge. We also offer short-term engineering support as a free service. For long-term support we ask to be included in the project budget. Due to our limited capacity, our engineering support in your project cannot be guaranteed. Our aim is to help researchers throughout Utrecht University and to keep innovating as a team, so we select our projects accordingly.

Would you like consultancy or engineering support in your project, you can contact RDM Support or our team directly.
